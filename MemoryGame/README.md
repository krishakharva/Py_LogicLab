## 🧩 How the Game Works

The game contains **8 pairs of fruit cards**, making a total of **16 cards**.

At the beginning, the fruit cards are randomly shuffled and placed on a 4 × 4 grid.

The player:

1. 🖱️ Clicks on the first card.
2. 🧠 Memorizes the revealed fruit.
3. 🖱️ Clicks on a second card.
4. 🔍 The game checks whether both cards match.
5. ✅ If they match, the cards are removed with an animation and the player earns points.
6. ❌ If they don't match, both cards are hidden again.
7. 🔁 Continue until every pair has been matched.

The game keeps track of the player's **score and number of moves**.

## 🏆 Scoring System

Every successfully matched pair awards:

**+10 points**

The game also displays the number of moves taken to complete all pairs.

If you complete the game in exactly **8 moves**, you receive:

> ⭐ PERFECT!

## ✨ Visual Effects

The game includes several visual effects to make the gameplay more engaging:

### 🃏 Card Reveal

Cards display their hidden fruit when clicked.

### ✨ Matching Animation

When a matching pair is found, the cards play a shrinking animation before disappearing.

### 🎉 Celebration Particles

After all pairs are matched, colorful particles and confetti-style effects appear on the screen.

### 📊 Progress Bar

A progress bar visually displays how many cards have already been matched.

### 🖱️ Hover Effect

Cards respond visually when the mouse moves over them.
